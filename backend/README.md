# Trivia API

## About

**Trivia API** is used as the back-end for **Udacitrivia** full-stack web application.

**Udacitrivia** front-end uses **Trivia API** to retrieve, store, and manipulate questions and categories in order to play a game of trivia.

## Getting Started

### Create Trivia Database

Create a database called **"trivia"** which will be used by the API to store questions and categories data.

Open up a new shell terminal and type in the following commands:

1. Follow this guide to [Install PostgreSQL ](https://www.postgresqltutorial.com/install-postgresql/) on your machine
2. Follow this guide to [Start PostgreSQL service](https://tableplus.com/blog/2018/10/how-to-start-stop-restart-postgresql-server.html) on your machine
3. Create a new database called **"trivia"**
    ```bash
    dropdb trivia && createdb trivia
    ```
4. Create a new database called **"trivia_test"** which is used for testing (optional)
    ```bash
    dropdb trivia_test && createdb trivia_test
    ```

### Setup Virtual Environment (Optional)

Follow this guide to [Setup a Virtual Environment](https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/) and **activate** it then continue following the next steps using virtual env.

```bash
pip install virtualenv
virtualenv env
```

##### Activation:

```bash
# Windows
	env\Scripts\activate
# Mac OS / Linux:
	source env/bin/activate
```

### Install Dependencies

Install all required packages:

```bash
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

# Test API

Run the following command to test **Trivia API**:

```bash
cd backend
py test_flaskr.py
```

# Set Flask App

Set flask app to flaskr and environment to development (debug).

```bash
# Windows
cd backend
set FLASK_APP=flaskr
set FLASK_ENV=development

# Mac OS / Linux
cd backend
export FLASK_APP=flaskr
export FLASK_ENV=development
```

### Migrate Database Schema

Initialize and upgrade a migration for **trivia** database to create the tables necessary for the API to function correctly:

```bash
cd backend
flask db init
flask db migrate
flask db upgrade
```

### Add Template Data

Here are some data to insert into your questions and categories tables to simulate real data.

**Categories:**
